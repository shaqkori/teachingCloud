## Responsivity

### Mobile First Design

This website was designed with mobile users in mind first, ensuring the all elements can shrink to fit the smallest screens without the overall structure of the page being broken. This is to ensure that the website can be accessible to any user on any device.

To achieve this, the design relies heavily on persentage-based widths and rem sizing, which fits the structure of the mobile view whilst also being able to expand to larger view ports with out the need to specifically define within a meadia query. However, meadia queries where used for elements such as the hamburger in the Nav burger so that when the screen size hits a certain length it no longer displays and instead the nav elements switch to display flex with space between instead of being stacked.

Adaptive images are used so the images resize automatically with rules such as max-width: 100%. which allows an image to grow to the width of the conainter without affecting the structure of the webpage.

### Larger Screens

For larger screens simple meadia queries where used to modify the page layout such that everything is not cramped to just accomodate mobile views. Such as the the nav element with the nav items. Also display: grid is utilised fo the flip card elements to create a 2 by 2 grid on a larger screen and ensures the elements keep shape and fit the container so the content is readable.
